# Nikto MCP Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
AI agents need secure, programmatic access to web vulnerability scanning tools. Currently, Nikto requires manual command-line interaction, making it difficult for AI systems to leverage its capabilities effectively.

### Solution
The Nikto MCP server bridges this gap by providing:
- A standardized protocol (MCP) for AI-to-tool communication
- Type-safe interfaces preventing common integration errors
- Secure execution environment protecting host systems
- Extensible architecture allowing custom scanning workflows

## How It Works

### Core Workflow
1. AI agents connect to the MCP server
2. Server exposes Nikto capabilities as typed tools/resources
3. Agents request scans with validated parameters
4. Server executes Nikto in sandboxed environment
5. Results returned in structured formats (JSON/CLI)

### User Experience Goals
- **For AI Developers**: Simple, predictable API for vulnerability scanning
- **For Security Teams**: Automated scanning with full audit trails
- **For DevOps**: Integration into CI/CD pipelines via REST API
- **For Researchers**: Extensible platform for custom security modules

## Key Benefits
- **Type Safety**: Eliminates runtime errors from malformed commands
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom scanning logic
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution prevents system compromise
- **Compatibility**: Stays in sync with official Nikto releases
